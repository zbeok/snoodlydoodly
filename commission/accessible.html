    <h1>
      TERMS OF SERVICE
    </h1>
    <p>These terms and conditions are here to both protect me as an artist and you (and/or any representatives) as a
      client. They apply to you when you have commissioned a work from me, and apply to me for the purposes of creating
      the work, and can be changed when is agreed upon by both parties. They no longer apply when the fees are paid and
      the work is finished. </p><br>
    <p>TL;DR: I will be lenient but if you have commissioned work from me, you are bound by these rules, please do not
      abuse them.</p><br>
    <p><b>THE WORK</b></p>
    <p>- The artist maintains that they have the ability to produce the agreed-upon work, and will create an original.
    </p>
    <p>- Approximately 5 revisions are permitted, any additional revisions will incur further fees, to be discussed
      later.</p>
    <p>- The artist retains all rights to the work, including distribution, reproduction, and promotion unless otherwise
      discussed, but will not reuse the art for commercial gain.</p>
    <p>- The client will receive the original completed work and may reupload it with credit, unless otherwise
      discussed. They are allowed to alter and reuse the work but with credit and not for commercial gain.</p>
    <p>- For commercial use, this agreement does not apply. A separate agreement can be drafted in that case.</p><br>
    <p><b>DEADLINES</b></p>
    <p>- The work must be completed either within one year of the first payment or on a date discussed by the client and
      artist. </p>
    <p>- If the work is not done by then, the client can consider this a termination of the agreement on the artist's
      part and request a full refund, if they wish.</p><br>
    <p><b>COMPENSATION</b></p>
    <p>- Payment will be made before the artist begins working and is due 7 days after agreement to pay, upon which the
      artist will consider it a premature termination of the agreement. </p>
    <p>- In event that the commission is considered a donation commission, </p><br>
    <p><b>TERMINATION</b></p>
    <p>- If the work is not completed (a fact agreed upon by both artist and client) and the client would like to
      terminate the agreement, they must pay partial compensation at 25% of final price per draft shared. The client
      will not be entitled to any rights to the work. </p>
    <p>- The artist may terminate the agreement due to any reason and will not be held liable for it; they will provide
      the client a full refund.</p>
    <p>- The work is considered to be accepted if the client does not contact the artist after 7 days.</p><br>
    <p><b>LEGAL STUFF</b></p>
    <p>- The artist and client maintain a non-exclusive independent contractor relationship. (e.g. The artist may take
      on new clients without client approval)</p>
    <p>- Any losses/damages/liabilities/legal fees, etc incurred as a result of this work is not my obligation, e.g.
      copyright breach.</p>
    <p>- The rules applicable here are under California law and state courts.</p>
    <p>- I reserve the right to pursue litigation.</p><br>

  <h1>rules</h1>
  <p>These are not hard and fast rules, so please use your best judgement to gauge what's appropriate.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>I will not draw:</p>
  <p>- offensive content of any kind (for example: racist content, misogynistic content, and on occasion, memes.) This
    is determined on a case by case basis.</p><br>
  <p>I can draw <b>(with caveats)</b>:</p>
  <p>- nsfw (if I'm comfortable, can be discussed)</p>
  <p>- furries (gladly, but no sexual content)</p>
  <p>- mecha (there's no caveats, people often put them in the don't draw list so i wanted to specify. they're cool)</p>
  <p>- your pets (please let me draw your dog)</p><br>
  <p>I reserve the right to refuse any request for any reason.</p><br>
